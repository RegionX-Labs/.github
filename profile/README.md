We warmly welcome contributions from the community and are thrilled that you're interested in participating in our project! To maintain the quality and consistency of our codebase, please follow these guidelines when contributing.

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This will be your private workspace for making changes.

2. **Clone the Fork**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine to start working on the changes.

### Making Contributions

1. **Pick an Issue**: Begin by selecting an issue to work on from one of our repositories. If you have a new idea or a bug fix that's not listed, feel free to open a new issue. Please ensure the issue is not assigned to someone else or marked as "in progress".

2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch in your forked repository for each issue you work on. Please use a descriptive branch name that reflects the issue.

3. **Code**: Write your code following the project's coding standards and best practices. Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and tested.

### Submitting Changes

1. **Commit Your Changes**: Once your changes are complete, commit them to your branch. Use clear and concise commit messages, ideally with the issue number for reference.

2. **Pull Request**: Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the main repository. In the pull request description, reference the issue it resolves (e.g., "Resolves #123"). Describe your changes and any relevant details that might help reviewers understand your contribution.

3. **Code Review**: Wait for the code review by the maintainers. Be open to feedback and ready to make any necessary revisions.

### Best Practices

- Ensure your code adheres to the project's style guide.
- Write unit tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Keep your commits small and focused; one feature or fix per commit.
